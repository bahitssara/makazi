            <h3>Hein de Waal – Owner</h3>
            <p>
            Hein was born and raised in Africa with having the opportunity to experience first hand the real needs and requirements of people in third world countries, low income and remote communities, and people living in the aftermath of war and conflict. This ignited a drive and desire to find a practical and workable solution to one of the world’s biggest issues. 
            <br/><br/>
            Seeing a young girl outside a dilapidated hut in a small African village on a cold and smokey morning made him realize that her options were severely limited by her environment and that she will most likely never get to achieve the possible greatness she might have been capable of. Even though she might have had the capacity to find the cure for cancer or to be the first person to land on Mars, her skills and talents will be wasted by having to spend hours upon hours fetching drinkable water for her family or carving out a meager existence in a cruel and unforgiving world. Instead of having the opportunity to study and excel, she will be doomed to a life of survival and uncertainty. Looking at what was offered as possible options today, it soon became clear that most designs and products only addressed some of the most basic requirements, like keeping the rain off their backs. Little or no attention was given to the more important aspects to turn these low-cost temporary ideas into real livable long term solutions, addressing every design criteria needed to provide a longer-term real life and workable solution.
