            <h3>Hein de Waal â€“ Owner</h3>
            <p>
            Born and raised in Africa, Hein had the unique opportunity to experience first-hand the real needs and requirements of people in third world countries. He witnessed the daily struggle to keep families safe and secure in these low incomes, remote and sometimes war ravaged communities. It ignited a drive and a desire to find a practical workable solution to one of the biggest humanitarian crisis's facing the world today.
            <br/><br/>
            Upon seeing a young girl outside a dilapidated shack on a cold and smokey morning he realized that her options were severely limited by the environment she was born into and that she will most likely never achieve the possible greatness she might have been capable of. She could have been the doctor that found the cure to cancer or the first human to set foot on Mars, but her skills and talents will be wasted by having to spend hour upon hours collecting drinking water for her family and carving out a meager existence in a cruel and unforgiving world. Instead of having the opportunity to study and excel, she will be doomed to a life of survival and uncertainty. 
            <br/><br/>
            Looking at what was offered as possible options today, it soon became clear that most designs and products only addressed some of the most basic requirements with little or no attention given to the more important aspects to turn these low-cost temporary ideas into real livable long term solutions.
