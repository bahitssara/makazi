            <h3>Hein de Waal – Owner</h3>
            <p>
            Hein was born and raised in South Africa and after graduating from High School, studied Industrial Engineering at the University of Pretoria. Hein joined the military in 2005 and travelled extensively through Africa, continuing his travels even after leaving the service. During this time, he not only witnessed poverty and hardships, he also lived in some of these rural and remote communities.
            
            This gave him a unique perspective on the daily struggles, real life issues and actual needs of these communities. Whilst working for a large Engineering firm in South Africa, he had the privilege of spending even more time in war-ravaged Angola, building houses in an area devastated by the ongoing conflict. This further motivated him to find a solution to the world’s housing crisis and to find a better, faster, cheaper way of providing more than just another “tent”.
